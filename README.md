# Assignments_Exercises for C#

For csharp_assignments, the format Assignmentx where x is the number of the assignment is used. For example, Assignment1 is the first assignment.

The very first entry point will always be the same as the assignment name. For example, the solution Assignment1 will have a Main method in the Program class in project Assignment1.
